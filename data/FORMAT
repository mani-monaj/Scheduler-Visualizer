This is the proposed low level format to represent Matrixes.

c: number of cores
p: number of processes
p <= n

- All numberings start from 0.
- All matrices files should be in CSV (Text) format with <SPACE> az coloumn seperator and <NEWLINE> [`\n'] as row seperator.
- There is no naming standard yet.

The C (Communication) matrix should be a binary CSV Matrix of size (p x p) which shows if two processes communicate with each other or not. (1; true, 0: false)

he D (Devils) matrix should be a binary (p x 2) matrix. First coloumn is the process ID (0 .. p-1) and the second coloumn indicates if it is devil or not (1: true, 0: false)

The N (Names) matrix is the same as D with the difference that the second coloumn is a text. The names should not be wrapped with anything, therefor no space (or any other special charachters) are allowed.

The X (Soloutin) matrix is a binary matrix of size (p x c). X(i,j) == 1 in this matrix means that process #i is scheduled in core #j. i is in [0,p) and j is in [0,c).
