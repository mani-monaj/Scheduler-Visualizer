This is the Visualization part for SFU CMPT886 Project in Spring 2012.

To use this visualizaer you need a running web server with PHP 5.2+ 
installed. Apache 2 is tested and recommended.

To use this tool, copy the files to your web server. Create a folder 
named `cache` in the application directory and give it proper write 
permissions for the web server.

To data folder contains a FORMAT file which defines the format used to 
feed data to the visualizer. 

Start by pointing your browser to the list.php file.

Due to heavy usage of HTML5 and CSS3 please use a modern web browser to 
use this visualization tool.
